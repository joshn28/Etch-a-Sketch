# Etch-a-Sketch

The purpose of this project was to build a browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch. The skills that I've demonstrated throughout this project are 
the use of CSS Grid/Flexbox for grid and centering of divs and DOM manipulation by utilizing DOM methods to create, select and remove elements on the webapage as well as
adding event listeners to elements.
